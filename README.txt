A face recognition system built using python and openCV 
developed by Neeraj Kanoi

The facial features can be collected by the dataset.py program,
and the data is automatically stored in the dataset folder.

training.py is used to train the data of facial features in the dataset folder
and a trainer.yml file is created in the trainer folder.

detection.py processes the data in the trainer.yml file and recognizes the face
using LBPH special library functions.
